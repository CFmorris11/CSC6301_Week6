# CSC6301_Week6
# Data Structures Conversion Project

This repository contains two Java programs demonstrating how a sorted data structure can be implemented using two different approaches: a **sorted linked list** and a **stack-based** method.

## 📁 Files

- `SortedLinkedListProgram.java` – The original implementation using a sorted singly linked list.
- `StackProgram.java` – A refactored version using stack operations to achieve similar behavior.

---

## Project Goals

- Practice implementing abstract data types in Java.
- Understand and compare the behavior of linked lists vs. stacks.
- Learn how to refactor code from one data structure to another.

---

## How to Compile & Run

Make sure you have Java installed. Then compile and run from the command line:

```bash
javac SortedLinkedListProgram.java
java SortedLinkedListProgram
